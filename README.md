# fishing-opengl-cgm
fishing is based on the human and nature interaction theme which is 2D
interactive animation. The fisherman comes near the sea and drops the fishing rod into the
water to catch the fishes. Then finally the fisherman catches the fishes from the sea. We
have used scale and translate functions to set different objects and transformed them in an
animation. This project was created with the help of OpenGL Utility toolkit and the various
libraries associated with it. Each of the elements were created as a different entity and then
accumulated to form a animation.
